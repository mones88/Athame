Athame is a program for downloading music from music streaming and sharing services.
It is intended for educational and private use only, and **not** as a tool for pirating and distributing music.
Above all else, remember that the artists and studios put a lot of work into making music -- if you can, purchase
music directly from the artist as more money goes to them.

Since I am also caught up with other things I can't devote all my time to fixing and improving Athame. Right now it is
just a very buggy, basic tool which I hope will either be improved upon in the future, or be contributed to.

FAQ
---
### Can you add feature x?
I am currently working on a newer, WPF-based release of Athame which has all of the features of the current release plus features
like artist browsing, text searching, and so on.

### Can you add plugin x?
There are hundreds of music streaming services out there, so I'll mainly focus on the two plugins listed below.

### Can you remove the "Respect the artists! Pay for music when you can! Downloaded with Athame" tag?
No. The purpose of that tag is to remind people that Athame is a tool for **saving music from streaming services for personal use only**, and not a tool
for illegal distribution of music.


Plugins
-------
### [Tidal](https://github.com/svbnet/AthamePlugin.Tidal/releases) and [Google Play Music](https://github.com/svbnet/AthamePlugin.GooglePlayMusic/releases)
These are included by default

### [Deezer](https://github.com/TripleFrequency/AthamePlugin.Deezer)
A plugin written by [TripleFrequency](http://www.triplefrequency.com/), which works great and is available to download [here](https://github.com/TripleFrequency/AthamePlugin.Deezer/releases).

### Spotify
Currently, I have no plans to work on a Spotify plugin. A similar thing called [librespot](https://github.com/plietar/librespot) exists, so
maybe one day this could be ported to C#.

### Apple Music
As far as I know, nobody has documented the Apple Music API yet, so nope.

### Qobuz
Qobuz isn't available in my country at the moment, so I have no plans to implement it.

**At the moment, I am mostly working on the Athame core application, so I can't spend my time writing plugins for other services.**

Plugins are always distributed as Zip files - to install a plugin, simply extract the zip to the "Plugins" folder, which is in the same directory
as the Athame executable. A guide for creating your own plugins can be found on the wiki.

Then...
-------
Open the Athame.exe executable.

Usage
-----
Enter a URL in the "URL" textbox, then click "Add". It will show up in the download queue. Click "Start" to begin downloading.

If you haven't signed in, you can click the `Menu` button, then go to `Settings` and choose the tab of the music service
you want to sign into. You can also just enter a URL and click "Click here to sign in" on the error message below the URL
textbox.

Under `Settings > General`, you can change where music is downloaded to as well as the filename format used. There is an explanation
of the valid format specifiers on the General tab.

Build
-----
* .NET 4.6.2 or later
* Visual Studio 2015 (Express will work fine) or later with NuGet

Roadmap
-------
While Athame currently uses WinForms for its UI, this is a halfway solution to an ideal UI. I'm currently in the process of creating a
WPF UI to replace the WinForms UI, which will hopefully also fix many bugs in the process. I am also currently considering a cross-platform
interface (since WinForms is incredibly buggy on non-Windows platforms), but again this is just a consideration as writing a command-line
interface would take time away from porting it to WPF. A GTK# interface would also be possible, but would take a while since I am unfamiliar with GTK#.
There are currently no plans for a Cocoa (OS X) interface since I do not have a Mac.
